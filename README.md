- 📒 I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo
- 🏢 I'm recently finished my internship as a Software Developer at [Citylitics](https://citylitics.com/)
- 🍱 I love to eat - if you have any recommendations, let me know!

Currently seeking Summer 2023 internship opportunities. Please don't hesitate to [reach out](https://www.linkedin.com/in/a22yuen/)!

Fun facts:
- I built an igloo in my backyard and slept in it (I'd do it again)
- I made a bull whip out of tape and rope
- My birth date is on the 22nd, making my waterloo username very fitting 🥳
- I love to chat, message me about my opinion on anything and if I don't have one yet I'll come up with one!
